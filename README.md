This is a discord bot that I made that used to run on Repl.it before I moved it to a local machine

It allows users to grab information about their genshin account without needing to login along with performing many menial tasks automatically for you.

NOTE: The code provided in the bot.py file may not work for you as your browser's may not have the proper cookies that allow genshin's private api to validate you.

Try to avoid giving your cookies out as it can lead to others gaining access to your account.
Like the official documentation for genshinstats suggests, create an alternate account and use the cookies associated with that account if you were to make them public.
